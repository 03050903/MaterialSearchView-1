# MaterialSearchView
Android SearchView based on Material Design guidelines. The MaterialSearchView will overlay a Toolbar or ActionBar as well as display a ListView for the user to show suggested or recent searches.

## Download
To add the MaterialSearchView library to your Android Studio project, simply add the following gradle dependency:
```java
compile 'br.com.mauker.materialsearchview:materialsearchview:1.0.3'
```

This library is supported with a min SDK of 14.

## Usage

To open the search view on your app, add the following code to your layout:

```xml
<br.com.mauker.materialsearchview.MaterialSearchView
    android:id="@+id/search_view"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent"/>
```    

Then, inside your `Activity` get the reference:

```java
// Activity:
MaterialSearchView searchView = (MaterialSearchView) findViewById(R.id.search_view);
```

To open the search view, simply call the `searchView.openSearch()` method.

To close the search view, call the `searchView.closeSearch()` method.

You can check if the view is open by using the `searchView.isOpen()` method.

**Protip:** To close the search view using the back button, put the following code on your `Activity`:

```java
@Override
public void onBackPressed() {
    if (searchView.isOpen()) {
        // Close the search on the back button press.
        searchView.closeSearch();
    } else {
        super.onBackPressed();
    }
}
```

## Search history and suggestions

You can provide search suggestions by using the following methods:

- `addSuggestions(String[] suggestions)`
- `addSuggestions(ArrayList<String> suggestions)`

To remove the search suggestions use:

- `clearSuggestions()`

The search history is automatically handled by the view, and it can be cleared by using:

- `clearHistory()`

You can also remove both by using the method below:

- `clearAll()`


## Interfaces
Currently there are two interfaces that you can use to instantiate listeners for:

- `OnQueryTextListener`: This interface handles either QueryTextChange or QueryTextSubmit events inside the MaterialSearchView.
- `SearchViewListener`: This interfaces handles the open or close events of the MaterialSearchView.


## Languages

The MaterialSearchView supports the following languages:

- English (en_US);
- Brazillian Portuguese (pt_BR).
